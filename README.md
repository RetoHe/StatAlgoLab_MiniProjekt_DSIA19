In this project, you can find different classification models for classifying corona cases in Brasil. The dataset includes health data from patients from an brasilian hospital.

After cleaning the data and doing some feature engineering, we have used following classification models:

- Logistic Regression
- Support Vector Machines
- Naive Bayes Classifier
- Neural Networks
- Decision Trees
- Random Forests
